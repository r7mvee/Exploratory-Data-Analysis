# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This project is focused on exploratory data analysis, aka "EDA". EDA is an essential part of the data science analysis pipeline. Failure to perform EDA before modeling is almost guaranteed to lead to bad models and faulty conclusions.

## Business Case

Your hometown mayor just created a new data analysis team to give policy advice, and the administration recruited _you_ via LinkedIn to join it. Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, for now the "team" is just you...

The mayor wants to start a new initiative to move the needle on one of two separate issues: high school education outcomes, or drug abuse in the community.

Also unfortunately, that is the entirety of what you've been told. And the mayor just went on a lobbyist-funded fact-finding trip in the Bahamas. In the meantime, you got your hands on two national datasets: one on SAT scores by state, and one on drug use by age. Start exploring these to look for useful patterns and possible hypotheses!

## Outcomes
This Project made me realize how important EDA and visualizations can be. It made me read more about the data in the form of visualizations which helped me to design my hypothesis.
